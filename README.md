# Data-Science

This repository is for some of the Data Science projects I had worked on.

These projects include:

- Exploratory data analysis.
- Study of various Machine Learning classification Algorithms.
- Evaluating model performance and Hypertuning parameters to enhance the performance.
- Predicting of results using the created models.
- Conclusion at the end of each notebook to understand the insights.
