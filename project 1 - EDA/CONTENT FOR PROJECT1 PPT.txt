A standard way of profiling your data is through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This involves a deep exploration of the data, trying to understand its intricacies and properties as fully as possible, namely through:

Dataset Overview and Characteristics: 
Determining the number of features and observations, types of features, missing values, duplicate records;


Univariate Visualization and Feature Assessment: 
Analyzing descriptive statistics such as distribution, range, variation, scale, common values, missing values, possible outliers, and evaluating the need for re-indexing, reformatting, or remove values as well as other operations such as data imputation or augmentation;


Multivariate Visualization and Correlation Assessment:
Investigating patterns and relationships between features, behavior or missing values, and assessing the need for dimensionality reduction and feature selection.



This is a thorough and crucial step in the data science lifecycle, but a very-time consuming one as well.
